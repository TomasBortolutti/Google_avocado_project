I selected the avocado prices dataset. I wanted to follow the change in the price of the avocado and find the main causes of it. 
I use power BI and clean my data in Power BI Power Query. 
Then I proceeded to analyze the data. I found some interesting insights. 
1.	I first analyzed the price during time. The price starts dropping in the period from September to November, and starts increasing between February and April, being these 2 months the moments with the lowest price.
2.	On the other hand, the price is low in the periods where most avocados are sold (between April and august). The avocado price is inversely proportional to the amount sold, as most goods. But here I see avocados are clearly a seasonal product. From august to December, in average, the total amount of avocados sold is relatively low compared to the other periods.
3.	Small bags are the most sold size (77.86%). Then come the large bags (20.7%) and lastly the extra-large bags (1.44%).
4.	The conventional avocados are highly most sold (94.76%) than the organic avocados (5.24%).
5.	In the second page, there is a scatter plot describing the relation between price and amount sold of avocados in average. We can see that when the average price is greater than 180, the amount sold is significatively low. When the price starts decreasing from 180, the amount sold starts to increase.
